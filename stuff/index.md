[Protein structure determination project](https://guyhwilson.github.io/stuff/cryoEM.pdf)  
*note: I was a wee lad when I worked on this project. It's bound to have some errors so be forewarned (also, lemme know if you see any!)

Bounds, Boundaries, and Betti Numbers, Oh My! The Role of Hodge Theory in Laplacian Matrices and Computational Homology  
*part 1 of a 2-part dive into computational homology; will upload part 2 (persistent homology) in a little bit I promise
